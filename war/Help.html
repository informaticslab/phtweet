	<H4>WHAT IS THIS PROTOTYPE:</H4>
	<p>
		This prototype is a Twitter visualization tool.   
	</p>

	<H4>WHAT DOES THIS PROTOTYPE DO?:</H4>
	<p>
		The user enters terms that they are interested in tracking via the configuration panel. The prototype
		tracks Tweets that contain the tracking terms. It display various attributes regarding the tracked Tweet
		terms. Each tracked term is represented by a circle or "Tweet Bubble", which is plotted onto a two dimensional
		graph. The following list provides details about what information is presented in the PHTweet graphics:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The radius of the circle is the absolute value of the delta in number of Tweets between the last minute
		    and the previous minute. Essentially, it depicts the minute-by-minute rate of change.
	 	</li>
		<li>
			Circles that are above the central, horizontal, blue line are those where the change in the number of
			minute-to-minute Tweets are positive. Those below the line represent those where the change is negative.
			The height above (or depth below) the central blue line represents the value of the delta. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Those Tweet terms which are growing are red in color. Those that are decreasing are blue. The opacity
			of the color represents the percentage of change as it relates to the total number of past minute Tweets
			for that term.
		</li>
		<li>
			The position of the circle on the x-axis shows the number of Tweets for that term over the past hour.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		There are two sliders above the graphics. The one to the left sets the refresh rate in number of seconds.
		It defaults to 15 seconds. The slider on the right sets the visibility threshold. This is based on the 
		percentage rate of change. By default, it is set to 10%. Any Tweet terms where the percentage rate of change
		is below 10% will not be shown. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Hovering over a circle with the mouse pointer will generate a popup containing a list of relevant data for
		that particular Tweet term. 
	</p>
